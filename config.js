    You look so pretty today. I love your smile, the way you look at me, and the way you talk to me.  
    I love when you call me bong every single minute.  
    I am absolutely joyful throughout my day when I am with you.  
    You are the one that I am dreaming of and the one I want for life.  
    Thank you darling for staying with me, believing in me, trusting me, and loving me for who I am — not because of my skin color or how I look.  
    Thank you babe for everything you’ve done for me so far.  
    I promise I will love you until the end of this world.  
    I love you so much, Oun Lin!! ❤️`,
